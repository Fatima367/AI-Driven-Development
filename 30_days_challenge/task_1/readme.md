# AIDD 30-Day Challenge — Task 1

### REFLECTION ACTIVITY:

## 1. What does AI-Driven Development mean to me?
AI-Driven development means working along with AI as our coding partner. AI writes the entire code, we just give instructions on what to make and evaluate the output of AI. It eliminates the need of manually writing code for hours, saving our time to focus more on architecture, design and making a better solution to a problem. It increases our productivity 10x because we focus more on creativity rather than spending time on repetitive coding tasks.

## 2. How do I see the future of Human–AI Collaboration?
The future of Human-AI Collaboration is the AI will work as code-writer who writes code, test cases etc while Humans will be Orchestrators who will direct the AI what to make and review the output of AI. Humans will design architectures and creative solutions and AI will implement human intent to code.
