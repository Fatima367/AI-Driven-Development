**Task Objective** 
Create Claude Sub-Agents in /.claude/agents for generating a book. 

### What are Sub-Agents?
Sub-Agents are specialized AI agents that work together under a main orchestrator to handle different parts of a complex task.

For example, in book writing:
- One sub-agent researches
- Another writes
- Another edits
The orchestrator coordinates them all.

**Creating and Orchestrating Sub-Agents** 

**Learn how to create and orchestrate Sub-Agents that work together to write a complete book.** 

[**Claude Code Sub-Agents Documentation**](https://ai-native.panaversity.org/docs/AI-Tool-Landscape/claude-code-features-and-workflows/subagents-and-orchestration)

**Steps:** 

1.  **Study the Sub-Agents and Orchestration documentation** 

2.  **Create book writing Sub-Agents** 


**Tip: Focus on building Sub-Agents that collaborate efficiently and cover all key aspects of book writing.**
